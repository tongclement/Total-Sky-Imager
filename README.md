Total Sky Imager - Team Harrow (Team Name: "Better Name Pending")
A team of 4 students competing in the HKU Computer Science Department x Hong Kong Observatory Total Sky Imager Competition to design a self contained device that captures, analyizes, and outputs the cloud cover in oktas. 

Our team decided to adopt the approach of using a sub 1000HKD ($100USD) Xiaomi mobile phone attached to one of the widest fisheye external lenses avilable for smartphones to capture the sky. It is enclosed in a 3D printed waterproof casing with an acrylic dome, and it was to be powered via solar power.
We managed to develop the algorithm before the Covid-19 pandemic was hit and the competition was postponed.

Team Members: 
- Clement Tong (Harrow 24')
- Edward Wei (Harrow 23', Cambridge Engineering)
- Callum Sanders (Harrow 24')
- Cyrus Chow (Harrow 24')
