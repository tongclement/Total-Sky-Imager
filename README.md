Total Sky Imager - Team Harrow (Team Name: "Better Name Pending")
A team of 4 students competing in the HKU Computer Science Department x Hong Kong Observatory Total Sky Imager Competition to design a self contained device that captures, analyizes, and outputs the cloud cover in oktas. 

Our team decided to adopt the approach of using a sub 1000HKD ($100USD) Xiaomi mobile phone attached to one of the widest fisheye external lenses avilable for smartphones to capture the sky. It is enclosed in a 3D printed waterproof casing with an acrylic dome, and it was to be powered via solar power. 
We managed to develop a computer vision algorithm that detects the sky, clouds, lens flares, the sun, and more edge cases by colour fingerprints and implement an android app to run the algorithm before the Covid-19 pandemic was hit and the competition was postponed.
